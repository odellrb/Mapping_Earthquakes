# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
On this project we used Leaflet, Mapbox API, and earthquake data from the USGS web page to build a webpage with a map showing seismic activity for the last seven days around the world. The user has the abiltiy to change between three different map layers as well as select major earthquakes, earthquakes, and fault lines. The data and fault lines show that most activity lies near the major fault lines.
